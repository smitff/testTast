Questions Answers:
    a.) What does our homework mainly examine?
        It mainly examine the knowledge of Industry standard coding practices, design patterns, and architecture.        
        It also exammines the capability of the candidate to write clean, maintainable, and testable code using redux and react hooks.
        As the test containes the real world problems so It checks the following skills:
            1.) Flatlist with large dataset (Usage of useCallback or useMemo hook)
            2.) Pagination  
            3.) Redux   
            4.) React Hooks    
    b.) Which development standard do you follow?
    My approach to solve the problem:
        -Before starting the design and development, I have read the problem statement and understand the  requirements.
        -Based on that I will create a redux logic first on paper and then I will start the development.
        -I use the reusable components, constants and common styles.
    
    c.) Have you met any difficulties, and how did you solve them?
        No, I have not faced any difficulties while coding the application. 

    d.) Do you have any advice for our homework?
        No, but the project examines the knowledge of the candidate and it is good to have a test like this.
